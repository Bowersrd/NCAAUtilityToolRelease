# NCAA Utility Tool 2.0 

: INSTALLATION :
1) Run .exe and unless you know what you are doing, leave it to the default install path.
2) Run the program, you knew that.

: UPDATES :
1) Download new zip file when posted.
2) Run .exe and install in the SAME EXACT location as your initial INSTALLATION. 
3) The app will auto update while keeping all of your data in tact.
4) The app will prompt if you are ever on an old version. No worries about being left behind.

: HOW TO - COLLEGE PLAYOFFS :
1) Select your desired playoffs (4 Team or 8 Team)
2) Start at Step 1, don't get ahead of the game.
3) Open your dynasty file, see important notes below.
  3a) RPCS3 users can just load the USR-DATA file.
  3b) PS3 users can just load the USR-DATA file as long as:
    3b-1) The file name is EXACTLY 'USR-DATA', without the quotes.
    3b-2) The USR-DATA file is in the folder with the PARAM.PFD file.
    3b-3) You hit SAVE DYNASTY (as you should) when the file is ready, failure to do so will not encrypt the file back.
  3c) Xbox users MUST still use Horizon, Modio, etc. as normal then load the dynasty file.
4) To change teams and bowls, simply click the team logo/bowl logo. If it does not click, you are past steps of changing it.
5) Once completed with each step, MAKE SURE to click 'SAVE DYNASTY', otherwise you will mess up your file.
6) Once saved, you can close the app. Your file is ready to go back in to the game and proceed to the next step.
7) Continue with the steps, in order unless you feel like living dangerous (it is a joke), the app will tell you what to do.
8) Once you complete all the steps, you can advance past bowl week and proceed as normal. You did it!

: HOW TO - POLL EDITOR :
1) Select your dynasty file (before week 9 will NOT show CFB (BCS) rankings)
2) You can edit the poll in 3 ways:
	2a) Click team image of spot you want to change, selecting new team will swap the new team with old team in its entirety.
	2b) Drag and drop the teams where you want. Drag and drop TOP 25 and Drag and Drop #26-126. Cannot drag #26 onto #25.
	2c) Use the sort arrows to quickly move the teams up and down in TOP 25.
3) Tabs on the left hand side let you switch from BCS, Coaches, Media polls.
4) When you are done editing your desired polls, the floppy disk icon in the bottom right is to 'SAVE'.
5) You can edit all 3 polls and then save, you do not need to edit one poll, save, edit another poll. The save icon will go away after the first save.

: HOW TO - DB EDITOR :
1) Simply load your file following same rules as COLLEGE PLAYOFFS #3 depending on your system.
2) XOBX and PS3 users MUST hit the back arrow to re-save their file so it properly works. PC guys just close the app when finished.
3) Each change auto saves, CTRL + Z can undo changes if you screw up. 
4) Export simply exports the CURRENT selected table.
5) Import will import CSV records into the SELECTED table. Do not try to import SCHD into the PLAY table, you will mess your stuff up. The app will have a backup as mentioned before in the install folder.
6) If you load a playbook file, you will see SITUATION VIEWER, use it to tweak what plays AI can call and how often (PRCT).
7) Nothing is defined, its presented as laid out in the file. Hopefully will be added in the future.

: PLAYOFF TIPS AND TRICKS : 
1) The camera at the top left allows you take a screenshot of your bracket at each step and save to desktop to share.
2) The flash when you click 'Exit to Menu' or 'Go Back' is normal, it prevents issues leaving the app open during each step.
3) If you forget to backup, and I know you will, there is always a backup saved to have your back. It is located wherever you installed the app in the folder 'backup'.
4) You can only run one of the same playoff at a time, but you can run a 4 team and 8 team at the same time mixing steps if you have multiple dynasties.
5) As mentioned, PS3 users DO NOT need to use BruteForce. The app will open your encrypted file, decrypt it and encrypt it back when finished.
6) DO NOT start another playoff of the same type (4 team, 8 team) until you do all steps of the current one. Doing so will mess you up so bad.
7) BACKUP, BACKUP, and... BACKUP.

: POLL EDITOR TIPS AND TRICKS : 
1) You can only save file once (this is done to help PS3 users from messing up their encrypted file). Edit all polls you want THEN save.
2) Teams in Coaches and Media polls swap place, first place votes, and points.
3) Set up your polls prioor to using the playoffs for the best experience.

: FAQ :
Q: I am PS3 user and my file says "Corrupted". What now?
A: It just is not encrypted. Run it through BRUTEFORCE to encrypt it back or send me the file to help you out. Report when this happens so I can make sure it was not the apps fault.

Q: My version keeps saying I am on the outdated version. Help?
A: You did not install the new version in the same exact install location as previous builds. Uninstall all versions using ADD/REMOVE programs in Windows. Reinstall.

Q: My bracket shows placeholder teams. Did the app mess up?
A: Doubtful. You might have loaded steps in incorrect order or twice and saved! Start fresh, hope you made a backup, otherwise go to install location and inside 'BACKUP' folder is a copy before you hit save.

Q: My screenshot has a black window around it. Am I doing something wrong?
A: No, this can be caused by GPU settings. Right click the shortcut and click 'Properties' > 'Change High DPI Settings' > Check 'Override high DPI...'.

Q: #25 Northwestern in the 8 team playoff? As if... Please tell me, can we change this?
A: Sure buttercup, click the team logos and kick their butt out. Now, everyone is happy.

Q: Can we change the location of the National Championship?
A: You sure can, it only allows 11 locations, but you can use an editor to manually change the 'SGID' if needed.

Q: Can you make (insert # here) team playoffs?
A: 4 and 8 is good, sorry, be happy!

Q: My scores on the upper banner on the schedule are wrong after playoffs are finished, is this normal?
A: Yes, this is normal. As long as the scores on the actual schedule are correct, you are fine.

Q: I clicked 'Exit to Menu' before clicking 'Save Dynasty'. OMG. What do I do?
A: You calm down and remember we got your back, grab your backup the app created and copy it over top of your messed up dynasty file. You are back to where you were.

Q: I am on PS3 and my file says it is corrupted when I put the USB back in to PS3. What happened?
A: You probably tried to edit your file directly on the USB. For now, make sure to move the entire folder off USB and onto your desktop. Edit your file, then place it back on the USB. Looking at resolving this issue.
